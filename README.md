### Introduction
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.

### About Dataset
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.

The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.

The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.

### Interpreting Data

0 - I do not experience this.
10 - I experience this regularly, constantly/or to an extreme.

### Libraries 

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Numpy

## Results
From the analysis, it is very evident that music is an effective tool in regulating mental health conditions.
But not every type of music can be effective, there are many genres which may worsen situations, others definitely improve mental health conditions.
From the stats and visualizations, almost 75% of participants reported an improvement in mental health symptoms listening to music, 23% had no effect, and 2% thought it worsened symptoms. Self reported scores showed that the majority of participants had more severe symptoms related to anxiety and depression, with less severe score for insomnia, and OCD being the least prevelent illness.

Majority of the participants listened to music between 1-4 hours per day and saw improvement in their mental health symptoms.

Only participants under 40 reported worsening effects listening to music. With larger number of older participants would allow us to see if this is only for this sample or if music doesnt affect people over 40 in a negative way.

Looking at participants favorite genre of music, Rock is most popular one with around 26% of the total.

With respect to genre, there were few genre which reported worsening effects which includes Rock, Video Game Music, Pop, and Classical, others had a positive impact.

It would be intersting with a greater sample size to see how different genres of music may affect mental health and if changing what music participants are listening to alters the effect it has. All genres had participants that reported improvement in mental health symptoms showing it depends on the person how the type of music effects them.

Hence, Music seems to have a positive correlation to improving mental health symptoms.
