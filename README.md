# Music-and-Mental-Health-Data-Analysis

Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.
